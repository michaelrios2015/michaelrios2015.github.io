              Hi thanks for stopping by my website, landing page, thing a ma jig that does that thing with the other thing :) 
              <br>
              <br>
              Anyway my name is Michael though I often go by Mike I just finished <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a> in April 
              and now I am on the job hunt, which as far as I know involves no fire arms which is good because I only have meat arms.
              <br>
              <br>
              So I am very tempted to get into a really long history of myself or just link to <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/730/730-h/730-h.htm">Oliver Twist</a> but I will try to be brief.  Born in NYC, Public Librarian for most of my adult life (<a href="https://www.nypl.org">NYPL</a> and <a href="https://www.prattlibrary.org">EPFL</a>), now software engineer though currently
              not being paid for that.
              <br>
              <br>
              Go back to the <a href="../index.html">main page</a> take a loook at some of my projects and let me know if I can help you.
              <br>
              <br>
              All the best!!
              
              <br>
              <br>
              Sincerely,
              <br>
              Mike
              <br>

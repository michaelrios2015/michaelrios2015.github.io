					<p id="myP"> so I have been taking Computer Science or just programing classes on and off since 2013, I mean I did take some in college and even on in highschool so that's like 1995
                        or so why I did not stick with it I can't really tell you.  well yes I probably can in college is was just really fragile and doing badly in one class was enough 
                        to scare me off I can go on about this I was essentially a paper tiger or some such crazy and asshole you decide.  When I restarted in 2013 it was going  much better 
                        then I decided to move.  It was supposed to be an innoicent move be closer to my family it turns out my girlfriend was seriouly ill.. I would leave in 2014 she would die
                        almost 5 years later. In some ways I worked really hard to keep her safe in many ways I did not understand how sick she was and what options this really left us... anyway 
                        I continued to study programming and the like butr suffice to say thses were not entirely ideal conditions and at this point I don't really know what I want to do.  Or I do 
                        know what I would like to do.  I would like to take some undergraduate classes and slowly get the equalivent of a undergraduate degree</p>

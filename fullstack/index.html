              <p>I just finished Fullstack Academy in April... it was a lot of work but that's what you pay for and I got a really good grounding in the NERP stack (Node.js, Express.js, React, PostgreSQL) and I think I

            <p> So this is really just a read app. It is a bunch of financial data that I do not understand but my very smart
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-rios-0679355/">brother</a> gave to me and I know AI is involved somehow... Anyway in terms of just what it does.  Two Tables with a one to many relationship
              that can be filtered by four categories it's perfectly fine but not super impressive... BUT where the real thought came in was that I was just given four csv files with 8,000 rows each that I had to split into two different 
              tables and then recombine so one could search by month and year and that took some thought :)  </p>

            <p>A fun CRUD application which in theory could help people play basketball. This was my group capstone project, my group chose not to use the boiler plate and we built this from scratch. 
              I was a little wary but my knowledge of file structure improved exponentially so that is good :) I did a lot of the backend work I like databases and I like to think that I helped steer my team to realistic goals</p>

            <p> A fake coffee store CRUD app. We were given some boiler plate code to get us started, mostly for the authorization and the Oauth as we had only just learned that and this was our first group project.
              I designed and built the database, though as in any good group project there is overlap.  I was also really proud of figuring out how to use local storage to create a guest cart.  
              It was a fun project I hope you like it
